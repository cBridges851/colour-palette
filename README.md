# colour-palette
This is a program that converts hex colours to RGB and vice versa.

## Motivation
I tend to need hex codes when I'm working on styling websites, and sometimes I just have RGB values, so I wanted make a graphical application that converts between the two! It also saw it as an opportunity to practise the GUI frameworks I have been learning!

## Tech/Framework Used
Python - using Tkinter and Kivy
