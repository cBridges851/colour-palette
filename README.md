This is a program that converts hex colours to RGB and vice versa.

## Motivation
I tend to need hex codes when I'm working on styling websites, and sometimes I just have RGB values, so I wanted make a graphical application that converts between the two! It also saw it as an opportunity to practise the GUI frameworks I have been learning!

## Tech/Framework Used
Python - using Tkinter and Kivy for the graphical user interfaces. unittest has been used to write the unit tests for the logic, and PySide2 to allow the program to be opened via the system tray.
